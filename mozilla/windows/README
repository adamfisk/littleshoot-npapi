Added BOOST_NO_RVALUE_REFERENCES to preprocessor definitions in Visual Studio 10. See http://lists.boost.org/boost-users/2010/09/62542.php

Also started using precompiled binaries, available at 

http://www.boostpro.com/download/

You also have to run ./depends.sh for all the necessary headers for building the VS project.
